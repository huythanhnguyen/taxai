### Author: Development Team

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Develop a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that provides comprehensive tax filing services equivalent to the HTKK v5.3.9 desktop application, enhanced with an intelligent multimodal AI chatbot powered by Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) using Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite. The platform prioritizes traditional menu navigation for core functionality, with advanced AI assistance for complex scenarios and multimodal input processing.

### 1.2 Key Objectives
- **Traditional-First Approach**: Prioritize familiar menu-driven tax filing system as primary interface
- **Multimodal AI Enhancement**: Integrate voice, document, and image processing capabilities
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add AI features incrementally without disrupting core workflows
- **Compliance**: Ensure full compliance with Vietnamese tax regulations and standards
- **Accessibility**: Provide cross-platform access through PWA technology with voice input support

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Target Users
- **Primary**: Individual taxpayers in Vietnam
- **Secondary**: Small business owners and freelancers
- **Tertiary**: Tax consultants and accounting professionals

### 2.2 Core Value Proposition
- **Menu-First Design**: Traditional hierarchical interface as primary navigation method
- **Multimodal AI Support**: Voice, document, and image input directly to Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite
- **Progressive AI Integration**: AI features enhance but don't replace traditional workflows
- **Direct Document Processing**: PDF, images processed directly by LLM with targeted field extraction
- **Voice-to-Form**: Direct voice input for form completion and navigation
- **Offline Capability**: PWA functionality for core tax filing without AI features
